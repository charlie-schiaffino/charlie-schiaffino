On my free time im developing a free forum engine in django, hopefully it will be out very soon with my own gaming community.
I do also work for Cornershop by Uber so most of the time i might be coding for them and on my spare time coding that tiny forum engine system.

If you need anything, just let me know and contact me for further information.

- ğŸ‘€ I'm interested in movies and anime most likely...
- ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning React > Node.js to implement it on this backend forum engine asap.
- ğŸ“« You can reach me at caschiaffino@gmail.com
